# HailStoneTester
A C++ program to test large numbers for the Collatz Conjecture. Previous tested numbers only went to 19*2^58 [Source](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html), so this program tests from that number up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615, or the maximum value for an unsigned long long in c++.
